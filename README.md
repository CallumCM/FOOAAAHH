# How to Play
You're flying your airplane carrying a huge load of honey, when suddenly your plane explodes! You're falling and need to slow downâ€“if you go to fast, you'll black out. **Use your left and right arrow keys to avoid birds and airplane parts while trying to hit flying globs of honey to slow down. On mobile use the slider to control the direction of your fall!**
